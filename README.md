![Chipper_cash](./chipper%20cash.png)
## Background 

* Ham Serunjogis' foreign money transfer app named is named 'Chipper cash'

* The company was first founded in 2018

* Ham serunjohi is the CEO and co-founder alongside with Maijid Moujaled, the president of chipper cash

* The idea came from when the two co-founders met in 2012 and bonded through mutual experiences and difficulties in attempting to transfer money to and from Africa. Notably in one of Serunjogis' experiences he had to fly from London to South Africa in order to pay his Olympic swim coach due to his father being unable to do a bank transfer.
* With the company growing internationally, expanding to most of Africa, UK and the US, 'Chipper cash' raised $75 million revenue in foreign-exchange fees based in San Fransico alone. In the "in the first half of 2022 , it broguht more than $100 million" following the rest of the year, "the pair has raised $300 million in funding reaching a valuation of $2.2billion in November 2021".

## Business Endeavours 

* Unfortunately upon recent developments 'Chipper Cash' has suffered severe repurcussions from "Sam Bankman-Fried's now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange platform FTX". This has rendered 'Chipper Cashs' "$2 billion valuation to be slashed to $1.25 billion before FTX’s bankruptcy" as FTX financed a quarter of Chipper cash extension round. The extension round allows Serujogis' company to keep funding and receiving more dollars for the same valuation, ultimately what initially set the apps valuation to $2 billion. Furthermore the aftermath was led to downsizing within the company albeit before this incident the co-founders managed to close a $100 million in a Series C exension round. Though gaining its first capital, the pair sought and raised another $150 million series C extension round with FTX, which led to the sudden drop becasue of the Sam Bankman-friend scandal.
* The targetted targeted demographic for the company was mainly for African citizens to allow easier and efficient transfers around the country, however regardless of its intended use the U.K and U.S took an interest as well. The startup later managed to round up "five million-plus customers use Chipper Cash to zip money among seven nations including Uganda, South Africa, Nigeria, the U.K. and the U.S"

* Although Fintech company being a startup, Serunjogi and Moujaled developed a ingenious business structure that not only ensured the business safety but also grew in popularity expanding to Western nations. Their structure offers a no-fee, cross border payments and instead charges through a foreign exchange fee, crypto commissions and offering discounts and zero-fee transactions to pull in investors in funding rounds. The lack of cross-border payment services is alluring towards families transferring money, the lack of fees increases amount recieved and transfers of money which gains the company to recieve higher amount of payments through foreign exchange. This creates a "win-win" situation where both parties of the exchange are profiting. This opposes other companies and banks conduct oversea transfers whom charge for both or sometimes more. 

* Currently 'Chipper cash' technology being used follows a schema, cloud and email automation. 
Schema: the framework technology being usedfor tagging words in a collective vocabulary which can be utilised by your own company,
Cloud: Acts as the Hosting technology Allows the app to automatically save data or information onto the internet as opposed to the hardrive. This is mainly used as a backup or another route of access to a file, it also eliminates 
Email hosting: The web hosting technology is hosting services throguh small servers that allows automated emails to be sent out to customers

* The overall timeline of the company is 5 years, but during the past 5 years it has achieved a lot of milestones and kept increasing in value and money as the years went on. It mostly started with gaining a lot of seed rounds early on, and the slowly the money increased as each successful round.

* Other companies have also followed suit or were already striving and became competitors are as Eversend, Payrailz, and Wave


## Results

* The business impacts chipper cash has achieved is allowing easier transaction to be conducted in Africa allowing for better flow of money streaming through the country, while simultaneously offering it at a free cross border fee. Serunjogi said multiple things over their founded apps achievements such as “Chipper Cash is offering remittances considerably cheaper than anyone else,” and “More important to that is that we are now the first ones that I know honestly to be able to support Africa to the U.S. in terms of sending money.”. Following with the company significant growth of expansion to the U.S and U.K shows the potential this organsitation can have on possibly changing the rate or money trading transactions. 

* The app metrics are based on the of amount of users using the app and how much money is being transferred all around, currently having approximately 4 million users and its open network amongst 9 countries, employing more than 200 people. With its success the company has been able to raise more money amongst investing rounds, therefore raising its valuation. Chipper cash has managed to raise $100 millions opened up the the company being referred as a "Pan-African unicorn valued at $2 billion" and their aspiration into mainstreaming cryptocurrency.

* Becuase of the advantageous discounted rates and fees the app follows it has engaged more and more users to utilise this company as opposed to others. The lack of fee of overseas payments has made a company a profitable company in terms of underselling its competitors to look more attractive while simultaneously gaining high flows of money through multiple revenue streams. Such as actively recieving successful rounds from investors, high consistency of daily and new its foreign exchange fees earning the title of unicorn for the nations of Africa. Unicorn being the term of when a private startup valued over $1 billion and is a symbol of its sucess, representing the mythical creature as statistical rarity of many successful ventures. 


## Recommendations

* The overall business structure of Chipper Cash well done, however there is a lack of media training and company security; such as the FTX Sam Bank-man scandal. Because of the lack of due diligience and lack of quality control allow this scandal to slipp pass Serunjogi and consquently cost his company a lot of negative press, as FTX was funding quartely of their profits. The lack of affirmative action from Serunjogi by not addressing the issue publicly the company is seen to have lost of its reputation and its trustworthiness.  

* By undergoing the proper media responses and situations, the faster one addresses the issue the more trustworthy and sense of care for the public, this creates a form of trust and reliability with investors and consumers. In a sense its a form of quality and damage control, best to lessen the damage on the company in order to keep it afloat, from this one scandal alone it costed the Crypto app $850 million. 

* Poissible technologies that can help support this strategy by having an Alert ready when a event like this occurs, this and a messenger bot on the website or automated email to notifty all customers notifying the issue and all being done to fix the issue. A more thorough security program in preventing the scandal to be made public and maintain condidentiality.

* These technoligies can assist in getting ahead of the problem before it gets out of hand such as a special alert will go off for certain events that may happen, that ultimately will effect the comany negatively. By understanding the severity of the alert proper procedures and methods can be put inot place in preventing any more unnecessary blows on the companys reputation and image. Furthermore a stricker and more thorough security measure and code to detect any abnormailities may help in finding the issues before they were even made to fruition, creating a safer and easier way of maintaining the comapny status.
